Clone the Udacity project repo below, download my notebook and run in the same folder 


Udacity default [readme file]( https://github.com/john-reilly/Self_Driving_Car_Nano_Degree_Project_4__Advanced_lane_Finding/blob/master/Udacitys_README.md), provides an overview and many links 

Udacity Project [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines), students begin by cloning this repo and that gives them the images, video and sample code to get started.

Udacity environment [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md), a conda environment to ensure the code runs correctly 

Udacity suggested [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md), a suggestion for how the notebook should be presented

Udacity [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view), to explain how it is graded.
